            <div style="margin-bottom:80px;">
                   <p style ="color: #5d4d43; font-size:15px; padding: 0px 15px 0px 15px;">Jxie & Lzhen's bakery shop first started Baking in 2017 in the Suzhou Monash JGS building, owners started working as a Baker at the cake shop. 
                       </p><br />
            
                     <p style ="color: #5d4d43; font-size:15px; display:block; padding: 0px 15px 0px 15px;">The place is usually jammed with old-school locals, new-school locals, 
                         business men and art students. So quite the mix! 
                         The staff are like machines, constantly cleaning as they go around, 
                         a table need only be empty a few seconds before its cleaned off and has someone new on it. An institution.” </p>

                    <p style ="color: #5d4d43; font-size:15px; display:block; padding: 0px 15px 30px 15px;">Our Bakery offers a peaceful escape from LinQuan Street.
                        The sandwiches and pastries are above and beyond (try the carrot cake!) and the coffee is fantastic. 
                        There is plenty of seating space and mothers with prams would not feel uncomfortable. Inexpensive and very yummy, Jxie & Lzhen's Bakery is a satisfying experience!</p><br />
